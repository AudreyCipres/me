TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
range() function = returns a sequence of numbers that start from 0 by default with increments of 1, and stops before a specified number

range (start, stop, step)
start = optional; starting number
stop = required; stopping number
step = optional; number specifying the step size or incrementation

while loops; execute a set of statements as long as a certain condition is true
e.g.:
i=6
while i<6:
    print (i)
    i += 1

input function allows user input after a prompt parameter (a string that represents a default message before input)
e.g:
x=input(f"Enter your name:")
print (f"Hello, " + x)
