TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
I tried to plot a timeline line graph for the number of times certain incident categories were repeated through 2020, but I ended up doing it in the most inefficient way possible by listing every single variable and value into a dictionary. Then using the strings I defined with values from that dictionary as data to plot the graphs.
I've realised that this made it more difficult for me to provide a title for both the y-axis and the graph itself
