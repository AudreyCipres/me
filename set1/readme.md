TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
to test type in
python ../course/set1/tests.py
into the terminal
I'm still trying to get the hand of vs code's UI and am still finding it difficult to navigate
The changes in the source control panel isn't showing up with the expected files like exercise1 so I"m stuck
I redid the printing task code onto the script and am continuously saving the modifications I'm making in my lab report to see if the number of changes increases in the source control
fun fact it does, so now it went from 0 to 2
retyping the testing code of python ../course/set1/tests.py into the terminal to see if it'll work. it does
I redid the git configs for my email and name but the source changes are still 2
I've now realised that the number of changes in the source control being 2 didn't really matter, as long as it contains the correct modifications so there isn't an issue anymore
I can understand that the process involves modifying the code or script in certain files, saving, adding the changes into stage changes, commiting through the tick symbol, pushing the committed staged changes, and then finally testing to see if I passed.
