TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Refactoring makes use of a pre-defined function to create a more efficient and readable code for the next function (preferably one that recycles similar patterns of function as the previous)
I understand the concept but I unfortunately can't seem to wrap my head around putting it into proper practice through code

Recursion is the technique of using a function that calls itself one or more times until the specified condition is met
