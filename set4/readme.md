TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
[] means the contents inside are a list and needs integer indeces
{} means a dictionary and needs named keys
"requests.get(url->any)" takes a specific string from the url based on the respective argument within the url
e.g. adding the argument "&wordlength={defined variable for length}" to the end of the link after an argument name
I now know that adding ".append" to a list "[]" just adds whatever variable is defined in the argument brackets afterward based on whether there's a conditioned range.
e.g.
pyramid = []
pyramid.append("hi")
